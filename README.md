## Using geotagged facial expressions to visualize and characterize different demographic groups’ emotion in theme parks

This study aims to reveal differences in emotions across demographic tourist groups by gender and age. Based on geotagged facial expressions on social media platform, the emotion distribution graph was proposed to represent groups’ emotions in scenic spots within theme park. The trend analytical methods were combined to characterize the emotion distribution of each group. Through a comprehensive comparison, the results suggest that there are unique characteristics of emotion distribution for each group and considerable variations between them. This study helps researchers achieve a deeper understanding of tourist emotional differences and provides theory supports for optimizing tourism experiences.
